UrlRewrite 1.1
==========

While there are many Redirect / Rewrite modules available in the Sitecore Marketplace, I created this one to address the fact that most of them cannot create redirects that are Site specific.

In addition to adding Site specific redirect capabilities, I have modeled the data structure to closely match the functionality of Microsoft's IIS Url Rewrite plugin.
